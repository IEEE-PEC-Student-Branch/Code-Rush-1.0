On a windy day, two of the friends travelling across the city decided to gather cans after the wind will stop. They decided to gather all the cans in exactly K groups. The path is the straight line and they established a 2d axis on the path with origin at the start of the path.

There are W cans of various weights on the path and the distance between any two cans is 1. More precisely the first can is at coordinate 1, the second at coordinate 2, ... , the W-th at coordinate W. Initially the friends are at coordinate W.

The can collection task takes place as both the friends vacate the city, so the cans can only be moved to the left. The cost of moving a can is equal to its weight times the distance it is moved. Obviously one of the K piles will be at coordinate 1, but the rest can be anywhere.

Task
Find out the total minimum cost of collecting W cans in exactly K groups.

Input
The input contains on the first line will be the number of test cases followed by two positive integers, W and K, separated by a space, having the significance given above. The following W lines contain W positive integers representing the weights of the cans (line i+1 contains the weight of the can placed at coordinate i).

Output
The output will contain a single line on which the minimum cost for gathering all the leaves in exactly K piles will be written.

Constraints
0 < t < 1000
0 < W < 100001
0 < K < 11, K < W
0 < the weight of any can < 1001

Example
Input
1
5 2
1
2
3
4
5

Output
13

Explanation
It would be best to form the 2 piles in points 1 and 4. Leaves 1, 2 and 3 are taken to coordinate 1, and 4 and 5 are taken to coordinate 4. 
The total cost is: 1 * 0 + 2 * 1 + 3 * 2 + 4 * 0 + 5 * 1 = 13
