WORKOUT CHALLENGE

Frank and Benjamin are best friends, who workout together everyday. Frank has a strength of F and Benjamin has a strength of B. The strength of Frank, F is already given to you. Your task is to find the number of possible values of B such that Benjamin emerges as the winner.

The challenge consists of one or more turns. In each turn:

1) If both F and B are even, their values get divided by 2 and the challenge proceeds with the next turn.
2) If both F and B are odd, a tie is declared and the challenge ends.
3) If F is even and B is odd, Frank wins the challenge.
4) If F is odd and B is even, Benjamin wins the challenge.

Find the number of possible initial values of B such that 1≤B≤F, there is no tie and Benjamin wins the challenge.


INPUT FORMAT
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer F

OUTPUT FORMAT
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the number of values of B such that Benjamin wins the challenge.

CONSTRAINTS
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ F ≤ 10^18

Sample Input
2
1
11

Sample Output
0
5

Explanation
Example case 1: We must have F=B=1, but in this case, the challenge ends and a tie is declared in the first turn.

Example case 2: If B∈{2,4,6,8,10}, then B is even and F is odd, so Benjamin wins the challenge in the first turn. Any odd value of B leads to a tie instead.
